Steps To Create Working Chatbot in HTML & JavaScript
To create your own working chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, follow these step-by-step instructions:



Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js
To start, add the following HTML codes to your index.html file: This code snippet includes a chatbot header, a chatbox unordered list (ul), and an input field for user messages. By default, the chatbot will display a greeting message as the first chat “li”. We’ll use JavaScript later to dynamically add more chat “li” that contain chat details.


Next, add the following CSS codes to your style.css file to apply visual styling to your chatbot. Now, if you load the web page in your browser, you will only see the chatbot toggle button at the bottom right corner. You can customize this code to your liking by adjusting the color, font, size, and other CSS properties.

Finally, add the following JavaScript code to your script.js file: This script code will make your chatbot functional, which means now you can ask your questions, show or hide the chatbot by clicking the bottom right toggle button, and more.

Please note that your chatbot is currently unable to retrieve responses to your questions because you have not provided your API key in the AP_KEY variable. To get a free API key from OpenAI, sign up for an account at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

” Remember that when you sign up for OpenAI, you’ll get a free $5 credit for your API usage. If your account is older than 3 months or the credit runs out, you’ll need a paid account or create a new one with a new number to keep using the API. Your API usage and expiration date can be found on the account’s usage page.”

The above code provided follows a simple flow. First, it displays the user’s message in the chatbox and uses the OpenAI API to generate an appropriate response to the message. While waiting for the API response, a “Thinking…” message is shown. Once the response is received, it replaces the “Thinking…” message in the chatbox.

To understand codes better, I recommend watching the above tutorial video, reading the code comments, and experimenting with the code.

Conclusion and Final Words
In conclusion, creating a working chatbot allows you to apply your skills to a real-world application. I hope that by following the steps in this post, you’ve successfully created your own chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To further improve your web development skills, you can try recreating the ChatGPT Clone Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps you expand your knowledge by creating a ChatGPT clone with additional features like dark/light themes and saved chats using local storage.

If you encounter any difficulties while creating your own Chatbot or your code is not working as expected, you can download the source code files for this Chatbot project for free by clicking the Download button. Remember that after downloading the file, you’ll have to paste an “OpenAI API key” into the API_KEY variable in the script.js file.
